# Carribean Raster Engine [CR]

Carribean Raster is the evolution of two different engines:
- https://github.com/italrr/nite
- https://github.com/italrr/astro

It borrows concept, and code from both projects to build a simple but robust enough 3D game engine (also capable of 2D, of course).

Features
- Models are basic .obj
- Animations are interpolations of .obj(s)
- Font rendering on 2D spaces through FreeType
- 

# Cavern Rush / Rush In Dungeons

It's a 3D, randomly generated, multiplayer dungeon crawler.

# REVERIE

In the year 2100, a startup company specializing in psychoteraphy called `In Reverie Solutions LLC` was founded by Dr. Sally and Marcus Red, and Edmundo Miranda. Main offices are in Romdo, but the manufacturing is done in Luciras. They founded this company to work on their project thesis to transform it into a real product.  Their thesis was the continuation of another thesis published by Motomera Laboratories in the year 2078, known was `Dream Post-Ego Analyisis`, which stated the possibility of interpreting alpha waves with the object of studying behavioural patterns and sources of trauma in patients suffering from depression. After the breakthrough of fully digilitized brains, Century Laboratories created UHCI which allowed brain waves interpretation and thus Computer Interconnection with the brain.

This startup used these advacements and theories to create the `Reverie Reverb` (RR) or simply "Reverie". It's a machine capable of hosting a dream world in which dreamers can populate and inhabitate. In other words, it allows watching, interpreting, and sharing dreams. The purpose of this machine is to enable psychotherapists to accuretely diagnose patients with mental illnesses. Reverie doesn't require a digital brain nor a UHCI capable body. 

By the year 2103 the team made the first succesful run of Reverie. They decided to make the company public, but The Vega Group stepped in and bought them right away. Reverie was approved for medical use in the year 2110, and it's been thoroughly used since ever since in the field of Psychiatry.

The concept became very popular outside of therapy. Many people use it to share dreams with friends and their loved ones. 

## How does it work?

Reverie essentially creates dream worlds in which dreamers plug into, fooling their brains into thinking it's a dream of their own. dreamers in the dream world cannot tell they're dreaming right away, but it can be recalled by recognizing mementos placed in the dream. dreamers usually enter the dream world with their last 8 hours of memories temporarily lost. It's also not unsual for them to have forgotten their names, and the names of people they know. When asked in the dream, they usually come up with a fake name on the spot and believe it's their real name.

dreamers however can identify people they know by perceving the other dreamer's Psychical Expression. That's how they recognize people they know in the dream.

### Psychical Expression

It's the abstract expression of a dreamer's ego, id, and superego in the dream. dreamer's bodies in the dream usually are a reflection of what they're feeling and who they are. But they also emit an indescribable energy and only percetible by other dreamers that is completely unique to the character and highly subjective. This phenomenon is called Psychical Expression.

It's worth mentioning that a dreamer can inhabit the world with images of people they know, but that are not dreamers in the dream. These clones do emit a Psychical Expression, however it rarely matches the real people's Psychical Expression as they're just an image.

### Mementos

Before a dreamer is spawned in the dream world, they're shown a series of objects while connected to Reverie to form an subconcious memory of the physicallity of an object, and then stimulating of a fake synapse with the purpose connecting the feeling of the object to an verbalized unquestionable fact. It's completely abstract but the dreamers need to believe the object is real. This process of creating fake unconcious memories is called Esoteric Suggestion.

As soon as the dreamer sees this object in the world, they involuntarily recall and most of the time, verbalize the fact. This helps triggering certain behaviors in the dream world. The most popular memento is the one they call Ego Recall. It helps dreamers suddenly remember who they are and that they're hooked a dream machine.

### Esoteric Suggestion, Hidden Suggestion, or colloquially, `Influence`

An Esoteric Suggestion is the process of putting ideas or memories into a dreamer subconcious. People use the word suggestion because the dreamer's Id can usually tell they're being lied or manipulated. Reverie uses a series sophisticated technniquites to put ideas (Mementos) in the dreamer's head. It's usually very reliable, but it heaveily depends on the idea itself. The bigger and disonant the idea is, the more the dreamer's Id rejects it.

There's an entire field of artists, or "manipulators", depending on how you see it that specializes in Esoteric Suggestions. There are several methods to Esoteric Suggestion. The most common one is Echolalia or "Pop Song Effect", which is the one Reverie uses for Ego Recall.

Methods:
- The Pop Song Effect: The dreamer is shown a series of fake physical stimuli, smell, touch, etc. that all together form a physically impossible object while exciting the dreamer's speech side of their brain to repeat a sentence in words of their native language, this sentence is usually spelled as a song, usually a catchy pop song. When the dreamer sees the memento in the dream world they usually sing the words. It bets on the song becoming an earworm. This methods is only effective with really benign ideas as the dreamer can usually tell it means nothing and it's connected to nothing. Anything more personal, complex or of a bigger reach tends to be extremely unlikely to work.
- The Movie Climax: It's the most complicated, but if done correctly, effective method. It consists of orchestrating a series of cohesively interconnected experiences that the target goes through. It usually ends with a Climax, often landing in the realm of Deus Ex Machina. This Climax must be powerful, and unavoidably compelling to the target, to the point that their Id is fooled.
- The Horror Trope: This one is similar to the Movie Climax, but much more traumazating and thus ineffective sometimes. In horror, the experiences created are akin to inflict psychological pain expecting the target to develop a defensive mechanism that essentially persuades them to believe the whatever is the trauma inflicted. Most of the time the subject of this method would pivot around horror tropes.

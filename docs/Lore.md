# Cavern Rush (WIP)

## Setting

It's the year 2125. The place is the Dóluz. It's one of the first industrial colonies founded when the space age started 20 years ago, in Titan by Veracrúz.

In the year 2033 the first succesful self-sufficient, commercially viable, artificial heart was engineered by Century Labatories. Century being part of the biggest technological and medical conglomerate known as The Vega Group. In the year 2056 the first fully digitized brain was engineered by the same people. By the year 2100, cyborgs became the majority of the population.

In this future, humans are no longer born due to an accidental biological contanimation that took place decades ago when humans still inhabited earth. The Lazarus incident, or how people call it, Rapture, is an airborn virus, highly congious, engineered to modify every human cell's DNA to prevent telomere degration. However the virus was still in the testing phases. The virus had a major side effect that affected most people. It caused their blood to slowly thicken until reaching cardiac arrest, regardless of any medicine used. This thickening rate usually takes years to develop.

The virus was poorly contained and escaped from an unknown labotary. Around 6 billion people died prematurely in the span of 15 years. But the worst part is the second side effect that affected 100% of the population, it was absolute infertility. It took years before scientists caught on to what was happening. Everyone was infected, and there was no cure. Everyone's DNA was modified by the virus. Humanity was headed for extinction. It wasn't until The Vega Group that came up with a device capable of artifically fertilizing and growing human life in 2068. This machine called Eden takes DNA from a two humans (regardless of gender), and intelligently splices DNA information until putting together enough cells to kick-start a conception. The growing from mere cells to a full fledged fetus takes less than 2 months.  

The Lazarus Incident took place in the year 2061. As of today, 2125 there are around 21 billion humans spread across the solar system. The virus is still present today, ingrained in everyone's DNA. People susceptible to the blood thickening start showing symptoms in their early tens. When this happens, modern medicine dictates that the treatment is to replace most of the subject's body with prosthetics, starting with their heart and kidneys. The safe amount of prosthetics for someone developing the thickening is no less than 70%. The other 30% usually includes the brain.

Although Digital Brains exist, people don't get them unless it's absolutely necessary. Although there's no concrete evidence, but there's a trend that people who have their brains digitized tend to become completely different people. Some people believe that the soul lies in meat brain and thus getting a digitized brain equals to suicide.

In the year 2091 nuclear war broke out in Earth deeming it uninhabitable. Although it's said some people still live there in bunkers.

The people that managed to escape the planet before imminent destruction immigrated to the different established colonies.

The social and political implications of these events radically changed humanity.

### Azula Portable Nuclear Fusion Reactor (AZPNFR) or Azula Reactor or Azula

Azula Portable Nuclear Reactor is a design for a Portable Fusion Reactor proposed by a french scientist known as Piere Halloway in 2062. The original design for this reactor weighted 500 pounds, but there are modern revisions of it weighting less than 100 pounds. The Azula Reactor works similarly to generic Fusion Reactors, but instead of using steam to drive turbines, it uses a very rare type of metal called Azulumiun. Azulumiun when heated produces an electrical discharge 85% proportional in energy to the heat applied. Meaning it has a 85% conversion of thermal energy. This mysterious metal was first found in the core of an asteroid that was theorized to contain large quantities of diamonds. Azulumiun melting point is completely dependant of its ability to discharge. The more heated it gets, the higher the discharge. However, if it were to be isolated, incapable of discharging, it would start losing is structural integratiy. The start melting point of Azulumiun without discharging is 545 C. The material quickly cools off as soon as it's able to discharge.

The French government quickly took over as the first prototype was succesfully tested. The project was never made public up until Alana Industries reported their first successul test of the IVTE. The French government offered their reactor as the potential power source for the IVTE. Alana agreed to work together.

Azulumiun is a very rare metal nowdays, however there's an artificial substitute known as Azulumiun-1010, which is cheaper. Azulumiun-1010 is only 50% as efficient as pure Azulumiun, therefore its energy througput is limited in comparison. Most cheap Azula knockoffs are built using 1010. Low end ships that use 1010 could take around 300% more time to reach top speed.

It's worth mentioning that these reactors are incapable of reaching critical mass without the use of a fissible fuel such as uranium or plutonium.

### IVTE and Instrinsict Fields Manipulation

Interplanetary traveling was made possible by one of the breakthroughs of the century: the Interplanetary Vacuumless Thrust Engine (IVTE, or `eeft` as it's known colloquially). IVTE produces immense accelation capable of reaching 0.99c (99% of the speed of light) in less than one minute. This is however only possible with a Massless Drive (MD). The Massless Drive is capable of physically faking the mass of objects connected to the field (including the IVTE), meaning objects within or inside of the husk of the spaceship weight less than a gram but only to the engine as the effect is purely relativistic. One issue of the IVTE is that combining it with the Massless Drive, causes a massive gravitational pull and push around the ship that could potentially cause havok around civialian areas. That's why it's highly illegal engaging full throttle with the IVTE close to a populated areas. There are systems in place to take down any ship that engages full throttle within the bounds of a colony or space station.

The IVTE and Massless Drive were both created by Alana Industries. The MD was the first created, and it was meant to be used for asteroid mining, but never left testing phases. The MD started as a paper on potential applications using Instrinsict Fields Manipulation on the Higgs Boson. IVTE also uses theories proposed by this paper.

The Instrinsict Fields Manipulation (IFM) was a major scientific breakthrough by the end of 2060s. It works through the usage of high energy beams on specific types of matter, creating some sort oscilation that essentially modifies hidden properties within the adjacent fields that composes _other_ matter and sometimes even creating a loopback effect that affects other energies in a chain.

The IVTE essentially creates trillions of concentrated gravity ripples within the span of seconds that in turn creates a sort of vacuum propulsion but because the effect takes place at the quantum level it's considered to be vacuumless. Thus the name `Vacuumless Thurst`. This allows the engine to create propulsion anywhere no matter the amount of gravity. It hasn't been tested, but in theory, an IVTE ship should be able to escape black holes as long as they haven't passed the event horizon.

The IVTE and MD were very power hungry, and needed a highly specialized setup to run. Alana proposed a concept of a portable nuclear reactor but was soon discarded when the French government reached out to them with the Azula Reactor. After both parties reaching an agreement, the Azula Reactor was selected as the ideal power source for the IVTE/MD combination.

### Theorem Of Jemeran and Zakzzuz in Space Teletarptulation

It's a thesis project by Livio Jemeran y Mellany Zakzzuz that tries to connect two fundamental qualities in the study of Instrinsict Fields that is speculated to allow space bending manipulation. Jemeran and Zakzzuz were born in right before the nuclear war broke out, but their parents manage to get them both on a Ascendance Mission Program designed for people of lower income to move to any of the colonies in the solar system with citizenship and scholarship included. Both were accepted by the UNT where they started their studies in theoretical physics after nailing the exam. They eventually joined the highly prestigious University of Grant Belvedere, located in Romdo. Grant Belvedere was originally founded by the The Vega Group, but later on the UNT joined the benefectors becoming majority owners. Grant Belvedere's specialty is its theorical and applied physics and medicine and cyborg medicine. The majority of the best doctors in the solar system come from GB.

Jemeran and Zakzzuz became the founders of a new field of study derived from the original discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN on earth in the year 2012. This new fields is known as Teletarptulation. In layman terms it's the study of space bending and its practical applications. Many scientists regard Teletarptulation as the next major breakthrough in transporation, superseding the IVTE. However many others consider it a waste of time and resources. Teletarptulation has presented a lot of problems and barriers. The first one being the amount of energy required to bend space. Every experiment made by both Jemeran and Zakzzuz has cost millions of GEMS to the University.

### Negative-Gravity-Vacuum Implosive Bomb

With the creation of the IVTE came another revolution in War Weaponary. The NGVIB is a planet destroyer bomb. It works the same as the IVTE, but in an inwards manner, utilizing a much bigger version than a standard sized one. It's also equipped with a several gigatons power source to drive the reaction. This bomb is extremely hard, almost impossible, to build. Only one group of people posses this bomb.

### Universal Human Computer Interface 

The UHCI is the chip that allows the brain to control the body of the user. It features a basic wireless (and wired) comunication protocol called Authority Through Extra-Spacial Fidelity (ATESF). This protocol is very susceptible and easy to hack, but is the prime, most basic communication protocol that all cyberbodies must use to interact with external devices. Organizations have built custom software that runs on top of this protocol, called Firewalls, that enhance security. It's recommended that most people turn off this protocol unless they need to use it because most software have vulnerabilities.

### New Internet or Internet

The New Internet uses a lot of the original Internet from Earth. IPv4 and v6 still work. However the vast majority of software and services use IPv9 for packet delivery. The New Internet routers use quantum entanglement for instant delivery of packets. The use of this technology renders issues such as signal reception/strength and latency completely trivial. The brandwidth of this network is theorically unlimited, but of course limited by the capabilities of the routing device. Any Interplanetary router is able of delivering hundreds of thousands of zettabits per second.

Although many personal devices still use electromatic waves, packets would eventually end up on a quantum entaglement capable router for interplanetary communication.

### GEM

The GEM or Gems is the official currency used in this society. It was originally concieved as a decentralized digital currency based on blockchain technology proposed by the currently defunct Alana Industries. Gem works through consensus from nodes in its network. Nodes require a 5th gen Quantum CPU to validate transactions. The fee for transactions heavily depends on the amount of Gems being transfered. Essentially all transactions must include the cost of the fee. One of the main features of GEM is a heavy degree of anominity using the Varsch-Dagguns Algorithm created for Quantum CPUs.

Although Gem is decentralized, and lacks tracking capabilities regarding payments, it's not hard to find the parties involved in a transaction, or the amount of it. But it does require a very capable last gen Quantum CPU. Most businesses use a thirdparty addon software in order to execute official transactions as it's established by the current monetary regulatory entity, called The Galatic Reserve.

Transactions with GEM are instant and reliable. It's also the main currency used by criminals to execute payments.

### Teleperceptive Projections or TPP or Brain Jerk / NeuroProjection

These are a combination of visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, and/or signaled emotions or feelings all packed in single a binary file with the purpose of being played back by a NeuroProjector within a simulation. They're basically movies projected directly to the brain, a like vivid dream, and thus reproducing all the stimuli stored in the file onto the user's psyche. The main difference is that the NeuroProjectors tries to create a simulation utilizing feedback from the brain.

Almost every UHCI chip comes with a NeuroProjector. There also are external NeuroProjectors that are latched around the neck, and a pair of glasses. One disadvantage between the integrated and external NeuroProjector is that the external one isn't capable of reading the user's feedback, and for this reason, the simulation sticks to the perception of the original recorder.

The biggest industry utilizing TPP is the porn industry. But it's also used in Education for training.

### The Genus Race

The Genus Race is a bloodsport hosted by the criminal organization Saborou. It started in the year 2099 when Saborou bought an abandoned Asteroid mining rig off the UNT that was adrift in Venus.

This bloodsport consists of 10 teams of 3 people that fight to death in this mining rig. There is no time limit. A single match usually takes between 3 to 6 hours. It's streamed across the solar system through the internet. The Genus is the brainchild of Jem, who was the original announcer until the third season. The GameMaster is Jem's fiance, Zanzan, from day one.

Genus usually takes place every 6 months. The winning team takes a prize pool of around 100,000 GEMS on average, which is the equivalent of 500 million USD in the year 2023.

Most players of the Genus are some of the most ruthless people in the solar system. The survivors and victors are considered celebrities. The death rate on average of a single match is 80%.

Rules:
- A team may consist of up to 3 players
- Only weapons allowed are gunpowdered guns, electric bows and any type of sharp non-electronic weapon such as swords and knifes. Non-energy grenades are also allowed
- Players drop from the start ship on a position on the rig of their choosing
- Players may only carry up to 12 pounds of stuff at the start of the match
- Players may equip energy armor and helmet to the match. These discharge with every impact and can be charged in specific charging stations spread across the rig
- Players must equip an Unemotic Control band on their necks. This bad discharges electricity to the nerveous system when players are outside of the zone. Players are completely disallowed to unequip this band. If they do, they're immediatly disquilified and escorted out of the game by drones.
- Friendly fire is allowed
- A player can at any time voluntarily drop out of a match by yelling the secret phrase at one of the camaras. Although this does not assure that the player's safety.
- Cyborg players cannot bring any specialized battle corpus mods.
- Cyborg bodies energy source is limited to 500 megajoules.
- Only the winning team can claim the prize pool.

UNT and Wayland often send their own official teams to these games.

## Officially Recognized States/Nations

### United Nations of Terra (UNT)
UNT was formed by former nations of Earth including: 
- United States Of America
- Mexico
- Canada
- Most South American Countries
- Japan
- South Korea
- United Kingdom
- Australia

UNT began as a massive international governmental project that started just 3 years before the war, in 2088. The USA government originally was part of Alana's project, but ultimately decided to drop out because of lack of control. They decided to buy the IVTE and related technologies from Alana, and start their own project. 

The official languages in the UNT are English, Spanish and Japanese.

The UNT has the simpler structure compared to others. The highest authority is a circle of 5 people voted in by an AI. All other government organizations answers to this circle. Laws are propsed by citizens through a system and the passing of these laws depends on a vote made by the same citizens AND the final say of said AI.

### Wayland
Wayland was originally formed by the EU, North Korea, China, half of Russia. but right before war it was reformed and declared its independency. Similarly to UNT, they also decided to buy Alana's technology and do their own thing from the get-go. Wayland started not more than 2 years after Alana started sending ships to space, in 2087.

The official language in Wayland are English, Chinese and Korean.

Wayland's government structure is composed of 2 major branches and a head of state, Prime Minister. The Zero branch takes care of the millitary, state security, and safety. They're usually independent, but ultimately answer to the Primar Minister. The Minute Branch takes care of everything related to welfare, education, and invidiual rights and laws.

The current Prime Minister of Wayland is Yuno Larel.

### Veracrúz
Veracrúz was an independent group of colonizers before the war, headed by Alana Industries, a company from Earth, the creators of the IVTE. The leader of this group was Sir Arthur Velanova, that named the group after his wife, Marta Veracrúz Velanova. The other half of Russia, India, and France were also major contributors and eventually owners of the project. Alana's project started after one year of the first succesful test of the IVTE in the year 2084.

The official languages in Veracrúz are English, Spanish, French.

Veracrúz's government is driven by the belief system created by Marta Veracrúz Velanova, The First Abadiú, before she died. Veracrúz believes that humanity is meant to conquer the solar system and eventually the entire Galaxy.

Veracrúz's government and society structure is a hierarchy tightly correlated to people's bloodlines and some nepotism. 

Abadiú:
    It's the highest recognition. Can only be granted by the Chief Officer Council in charge of Veracruz. In order to be a candidate to become an Abadiú, one must be blood related to a previous Abadiú. There has been very few rare exceptions to this rule.

Nebado
    Nebado are every other government official or related to government official, above the executive branch. Some specialties can also be granted this title such as highly succesful businessmen, renowed Doctors or Scientists. Nebados can become Abadiú if the council consideres it so.

Agacartas
    Agacartas are everyone below Nebado that are respected within their local communities, meaning managers, branch executives, public servants, etc.

Aerus
    Most people of Veracrúz are Aerus by default. It's the people below Agacartas, but contribute to society one way or the other and are not criminals and/or drug addicts.

Lacra
    Lacras are the lowest of the low. Usually unemployed, homeless, criminals, and/or drug addicts.

Nomads
    Nomads were the original Nomads and where the faction comes from. These are essentially monk that resigned to all technology, their names, lastname, family, loved ones etc. And give their life to the servitude of the Abadiú. These are considered non-citizens but more like slaves. Although they live a good life with food and other commodities assured. Nomads from Veracrúz do interact with technology to a certain degree, but the Nomads that left the state and became a faction do not (except for the usage of the Eden device).


## Major Factions

### The Federation for The Future Of Humanity or The Federation

It's an interplanetary effort composed by all of the Recognized Nations/Colonies with the sole purpose of peacefully uniting all parties involved in order priotize humanity's advancement.

The Federation ends up being an extremely corrupt organization at times. The federation is regarded to be completely independent in its actions, sometimes acting like some sort of Government of the solar system.

It's worth mentioning that the Federation is the only group in the entire solar system that posses the NGVIB. From time to time, do they tests of the bomb on remote planets and stream the live footage.

### The Vega Group

The Vega Group is a conglomerate of the most powerful and richest companies in the solar system. They have around thousands of subsidiaries. The board is made out of 10 trillionares, 4 of them are Abadiú. The VG's speciality is Military Technology, Medical Technology, General Purpose Sofware, and entertainment such as Movies, Shows, Videogames and Teleperceptive Projections. They also are the number one sellers of Android replacement parts and AI.

### Saborou 

It's a massive interplanetary crimical organization headed by Jem. Saborou specializes in contraband, slavery, and drugs. But they do, from time to time, jobs for the highest bidder.

Saborou also hosts The Genus Race which is their highest grossing bussiness.

Saborou is actually split in two groups that cohesively act as one. Although Jem is regarded to be the unquestionable boss, the other side of Saborou is actually led by Jem's fiance, Zanzan. 

### Nefastus

It's another interplanetary criminal organization. They're the rivals of Saborou. The leader of Nefastus is the unrecognized son of Marta Veracrúz Velanova, Alexander Veracrúz, that goes by the moniker of `Umbre`.

Nefastus send their own official team to the Genus Race. Nefastus holds 40% of the victories of all the matches.

### Nomads

Nomads are settlers in Europa that refuse to embrace technological advancements. They were originally part of Veracrúz, and decided to leave as they disagreed with parts of the scriptures left by Marta claiming it was fabricated. Nomads believe they're the children of the earth NOT the stars as Veracrúz believes. 

They believe that in order to be cured of the current ailments of infertility and the curse of early death (blood thicknening) they need to give up all technology and eventually return to earth when the radiation dies down.

If one their own is incapable of fighting The Lazarus Virus, they allow their death as a sacrifice. Although, ironically, they use the artificial human fertilizer created by the Vega group, the Eden, to keep their population from disappearing.

## Companies relevant to the game

# Similán Rocketry

Similán Rocketry is Spaceship manufacturer founded by The Vega Group in 2100. Their main factory is located in Orion. Similán specializes in the making of very high end spaceships. Their main line Infraray has some of the most advanced Spaceships ever created. Their version of the IVTE is capable of producing propulsion towards the front of the ship in a perfect 90degrees angle, something most IVTEs cannot do.

Similán has an office in Doluz.

### Tesla Industries

Tesla develops androids, and replacement parts, but also some lower-end prosthetics. It's mid level company located in Doluz.

## Factions relevant to the game

### Bibi Snakes

Bibi Snakes is a small gang situated in Doluz. They do small crimes such as stealing local companies' warehouses and incoming shipments to sell in the black market. Bibi is lead by Victor Vetsu.

### Bloodchungs

Bloodchungs is another gang from Doluz that started to antagonize The Bibis after they murdered Victor's girlfriend.


## Important Characters

- Sir Arthur Velanova

It's multi-trillionare from Earth. It's unknown how old he really is, but it's speculated to be over a hundred years old. Arthur is considered a humanitarian, and father of the IVTE that allowed the human species to trascend from earth according to Marta's Scriptures. Arthur's entire body is prosthetic, even his brain.

It's unknown what's dedicating his life to now, as he's been barely seen in the public after his speech about his wife's death.

Arthur is an Abadiú, but he holds no political power.

- Marta Veracrúz Velanova

She's Nuclear Physicist, originally from Mexico in Earth. She was Arthur's wife and also a self-proclaimed mesiah figure after earth was destroyed. She created the entire belief, societal and government system that Veracrúz uses today. She was in earth the day the war broke out, she managed to get on a ship, but was hit by a nearby dirty bomb. She having absorved a certain of radiation, was quickly brought to the best healthcare center in Neu Santos to try to replace critical parts of her body with prosthetics before her organs died out.

Most of her body was completely metal, except for her brain. No more than a year later she developed brain cancer. She refused to go through brain digitalization as she believed it would corrupt her soul nor any cancer treatment. She was given 6 months to live.

She took over Veracrúz's leadership as Arthur was nowhere to be found since the day of the war. She quickly developed Veracrúz's entire governmental system, assigning people she knew in positions of power and creating the Abadiú hierarchy. She's considered the first Abadiú.

By the end of her days she became very spiritual and developed a compilation of scriptures for her people to follow. She claimed she was blessed with pictures of the future and that she knows how humanity will perish but that she has the answer thrive when the time comes.

When Marta died, Arthur showed up to make a public announcement about her death.

- Jem 

Jem is a cyborg, extremely dangerous individual, wanted crimininal across all colonies, head of the Saborou Group. It's rumored Jem was born in earth. Jem posses a military-grade prosthetic body. Jem likes to be called by She/her pronous, but her body looks anything but feminine.

Her mother left when she was only 2 years old. Her sister Allison and Jessica left the house when their father died. She's been on her own ever since. She couldn't afford tuition at school, so she dropped out. She has dedicated her life to computers, software programming, and of course, hacking.

Luna is acts really tough, and sometimes even cold, but deep inside she's very fragile, and suffers from abandoment issues. Luna is 5'9" tall, slim. She's from germanic ascendancy. Blond, blue-eyed, white skinned. Luna enjoys lowbeat music, and loves Neo Oriental Animation (still called Anime). She's tends to be contrarian out of spite sometimes.

Luna helped the Protagonist because she found him to be interesting, the mere fact that the guy looked like a Nomad. Afterwards she stayed out of worry that they were going to die due the Virus. It's said that Luna's mother was also a Nomad.

Luna is a major character could become a major character in the Protagonist's story line. although the player will have the choice of working/hanging out with her.

Luna is also a potential romantic partner for the Protagonist.

- The Protagonist

The protagonist is a Nomad who was suffering from the Lazarus Virus, however they only started showing symptoms after the age of 18, and the onset was rather abrupt. Afraid of his fellow Nomads catching up to what was happening to them, they decided to leave Europa to seek medical help in Titan. He sneaked out the town, and ran away to a near-by Veracrúz military base, and stole one of their ships. But he was very inexperienced in interplanetary traveling. As he was entering Titan, he was shot down by the Protection Squad, as he didn't reduce his speed fast enough when approaching the atmosphere. Trying to survive, he activated the escape pod of the ship, and ended up crashing in the outskirts of Dóluz' Dome. A near by citizen spot his escape pod crashing, and went to help. The citizen that helped him was a hacker known Luna Mayer. Luna took The Protagnist to a blackmarket doctor where it was discovered that he was suffering from the side effects of the Lazarus Virus. He was quickly taken to surgery to replace his entire body with prosthetics. It always known to Luna and the doctor that the Protagonist was sort of Nomad because his blood and skin was so clean and he didn't have any prosthetics as where 90% of Doluz citizens had some prosthetics.

When the Protagonist woke up, he realized he was suffering from major memory loss. But it's unknown if it was due the crash, the rapid advancement of the Lazarus, or the traumatic experience of having one's entire body replaced with prosthetics in a single day which is unsual.

## How it starts

As the Protagnists wakes up, he's informed of the situation. He now owns thousands of Gems in prosthetics to Luna. In order to pay, he's offered a job by her, a cave rescuer. Dóluz is an industrial city built near to a system of caves where minerals such as Uranium and Iron in large quantities can be found. However this cave system tends to collapse very often due to the nature of the ground there. The company that owns the cave employs random low-lives for the job of rescuing expensive machinenary, and sometimes, engineer miners that were trapped underground from a collapse. These engineers usually have "Rescue" as part of their contract's benefits.

The protanists is destined to figure out who he is in this world, and either return to the Nomads or stay and live a new life in this city.

The city is completely domed, but the ground under it is actually highly fertile as of now, and inhabited by small purple worms. It's unknown how it happened, but it's said that a secret project carried by an unknown group which consisted in terraforming the floor using a mutated type of worm that survived by eating waste. It seems the city waste management system has been leaking through the base and reaching the worms, keeping them alive.

# Cavern Rush


## Setting

It's the year 2105. The place is the Dóluz. It's one of the first industrial colonies founded when the space age started 20 years ago, in Titan.

In the year 2033 the first succesful artificial heart was engineered by Century Labatories, part of the biggest technological and medicine conglomerate known as The Vega Group. In the year 2056 the first fully digitilized brain by the same people. By the year 2100, cyborgs became the majority of the population.

In this future, humans are no longer born due to an accidental biological contanimation that took place decades ago when humans still inhabited earth. The Lazarus incident, or how people call it, Rapture, is an airborn virus, highly congious, engineered to modify every human cell's DNA to prevent telomere degration. However the virus was still in the testing phases. The virus had a major side effect that affected most people. It caused their blood to slowly thicken until reaching cardiac arrest, regardless of any medicine used. This thickening rate takes years to develop.

The virus was poorly contained and escaped from the labotary it was created. Around 6 billion people died prematurely in the span of 15 years. But the worst part is that the people that were not affected by this side effect became infertile, women and men. It took years before scientists caught on to what was happening. Everyone was infected, and there was no vaccine. Everyone's DNA was modified by the virus. Humanity was headed for extinction. It wasn't until The Vega Group, that came up with a device capable of artifically germinating human life in 2068.

The Lazarus Incident took place in the year 2061. As of today, 2105 there are around 21 billion humans spread across the solar system. The virus is still present today, ingrained in everyone's DNA. People susceptible to the blood thickening start showing symptoms in their early tens. When this happens, modern medicine dictates that the treatment is to replace most of the subject's body with prosthetics.

In the year 2091 nuclear war broke out in Earth deeming it uninhabitable. Although it's said some people still live there in bunkers.

The factions that managed to escape the planet before imminent destruction founded their colonies in different parts of the solar system.

The social and political implications of these events radically changed humanity.

### IVTE

The interplanetary travel was made possible by The Interplanetary Vacuumless Thrust Engine (IVTE, or eeft as it's called colloquially). IVTE produces an impressive accelation capable of reaching 0.99c (99% of the speed of light) in less than one minute. This is however only possible with a Massless Drive (MD). The Masless Drive is capable of physically faking the mass of certain objects connected to the field (including the IVTE), meaning objects within or inside of the husk of the spaceship weight less than a gram but only to the engine. One issue of the IVTE is that combining it with the Massless Drive, causes a massive gravitational pull around the ship that could potentially cause havok around infrrascture or civialian areas. That's why it's highly illegal engaging full throttle with the IVTE close to a colony.

### Neutral-Vacuumless Implosive Bomb

With the creation of the IVTE came another revolution in War Weaponary. The NVIB is planet destroyer bomb. It works using the same technology as the IVTE, but an inwards manner, and equipped with several megaton power source to drive the reaction. This bomb is extremely hard to build. Only one group of people posses this bomb.

### Universal Human Computer Interface 

The UHCI is the chip that allows the brain to control the body of the user. It features a basic wireless comunication protocol called Authority Through Extra-Spacial Fidelity (ATESF). This protocol is very susceptible and easy to hack, but is the prime, most basic communication protocol that all cyberbodies must use to interact with external devices. Organizations have built custom software that runs on top of this protocol, called Firewalls, that enhance security. It's recommended that most people turn off this protocol unless they need to use it because most software have vulnerabilities.


## Officially Recognized Nations/Colonies

### United Nations of Terra (UNT)
UNT was formed by former nations of Earth including: 
- United States Of America
- South American Countries
- Japan
- South Korea
- United Kingdom

The official languages in the UNT is English, Spanish and Japanese

### Wayland
Wayland was originally formed by China and North Korea, but after the war it was reformed and completely distanced itself from these contries

The official language in Wayland is English 

### Veracrúz
Veracrúz was an independent group of colonizers before the war, headed by Alana Industries, a company from Earth, the first one to invest in the IVTE. The leader of this group was Sir Arthur Velanova, that named the colony after his wife, Marta Veracrúz Velanova. Russia, India, and france were also major investors in Alana Industries.

The official languages in Veracrúz is English, Spanish, French.

### Factions

### The Federation for The Future Of Humanity

It's an interplanetary effort composed by all of the Recognized Nations with the sole purpose of uniting humanity's advancement as the best interest for all parties involved.

Ultimately the Federation ends up being an extremely corrupt organization. They act as the bully of solar system. 

It's worth mentioning that the Federation is the only group in the entire solar system that posses the Neutral-Vacuumless Implosive bomb. They try to show a professional and humanitarian image to the colonies so they do not threat anyone directly with it, but they do flex about it through live tests of the device on distant planets to show the its destructive capabilities.

### The Vega Group

The Vega Group is a conglomerate of the most powerful and richest companies in the solar system. They have around thousands of subsidiaries. Their speciality is Weaponry, Medicine technology, which includes prosthetics. They also are the number sellers of Android technology.

### Saborou Group

It's an interplanetary crimical organization headed by Jem. Saborou specializes in human traficking and drugs. But they do, from time to time, heists/jobs for the highest bidder.


### Nomads

Nomads are settlelers in Europa that refuse to embrace technological advancements. If one their own is incapable of fighting The Lazarus Virus, they allow their death as a necesary step to overcome the evil in the blood casted by the forbidden techonolical advancement. Although, ironically, they use the artificial human germinator created by the Vega group, for new humans.

They do believe technology is evil, a given to humans by the Devil. They're waiting for the first non-infertile human to be born.



## Important Characters

- Sir Arthur Velanova
It's multi-trillionare from Earth. It's unknown how old he really is, but it's especulated to be over a hundred years old. Arthur is considered a humanitarian, and creator of the IVTE that allowed the human species to trascend to the stars. Arthur's entire body is prosthetic, even his brain.

- Jem

It's a experienced hacker and wanted crimical that helped The Protagonist when their ship was shot down by Titan's Protection Squad. 
Luna is the youngest of 3 sisters. Luna is around 22 years old. She got into Cybersecurity Specialist at School, and finished her junior year at 18 years old. But then her father died in a job accident. Her mother left when she was only 2 years old. Her sister Allison and Jessica left the house when their father died. She's been on her own ever since. She couldn't afford tuition at school, so she dropped out. She has dedicated her life to computers, software programming, and of course, hacking.

Luna is acts really tough, and sometimes even cold, but deep inside she's very fragile, and suffer from abandoment issues.

Luna helped the Protagonist because she found him to be interesting, the mere fact that the guy looked like a Nomad. Afterwards she stayed out of worry that they were going to die due the Virus.

- The Protagonist

The protagonist is a Nomad who was suffering from the Lazarus Virus, however they only started showing symptoms after the age of 18. Afraid of his fellow Nomads catching up to what was happening to them, they decided to leave Europa to seek medical help in Titan. He escaped the Nomads, and ran away to a near-by military base, and stole of their ships. But he was very inexperienced in interplanetary traveling. As he was entering Titan's atmosphere, he was shot down by the Protection Squad, as he didn't reduce his speed fast enough when approaching the atmosphere. Trying to survive, he activated the escape pod of the ship, and ended up crashing near-by Dóluz. A near by citizen spot his escape pot crashing, and went to help. The citizen that helped him was a hacker known Luna Mayer. Luna took The Protagnist to a near by doctor where it was discovered that he was suffering from the side effects of the Lazarus Virus. He was quickly taking to surgery to replace his entire body with prosthetics. It always known to Luna and the doctor that the Protagonist was sort of Nomad because his blood and skin was so clean and he didn't have any implants.

When the Protagonist woke up, he realized he was suffering from serious memory loss. But it's unknown if it was due the crash, the advancement of the Virus, or the traumatic experience of having one's entire body replaced with prosthetics in a single day.

- Norman "Doc"

Norman is the doctor that helps the protagonist after their crash near Dóluz.


## How it starts

As the Protagnists wakes up, he's informed of the situation. He now owns thousands of Gems in prosthetics to Luna. In order to pay, he's offered a job by her, a cave rescuer. Dóluz is an industrial city built near to a system of caves where minerals such as Uranium and Iron in large quantities can be found. However this cave system tends to collapse very often due to the nature of the ground there. The company that owns the cave employs random low-lives for the job of rescuing expensive machine, and sometimes, engineer miners that were trapped underground from a collapse.

The protanists is destined to figure out who he is in this world, and either return to the Nomads or stay and live a new life in this city.


## Dóluz

Dóluz is a city/colony is Titan, one of the moons of Saturn. Dóluz was one of the first space colonies, originally founded by Alana Industries. Now part of Veracrúz.
There are 50 million people in Dóluz. Most of them low-lives. One of the main joints of Century Laboratories is located in Dóluz. 
The main transporation is Dóluz is the metro as streets are too narrow for for full size vehicles. Most people ride their personal electric vehicles such as bikes and scooters, then everyone else use the metro. The rich people of Dóluz use Flying vehicles of course.

Dóluz is famouse because of its night life. Dóluz is one of the few colonies without regulations on sex slaves and age of consent is 15 years old, also drugs are legal except hard drugs.

Dóluz police department is called the Protection Squad. Most basic rights of a citizen Dóluz include protection from the Squad, but many of their services are paid.

# Cavern Rush (WIP)

## Setting

It's the year 2115. The place is the DÃ³luz. It's one of the first industrial colonies founded when the space age started 20 years ago, in Titan.

In the year 2033 the first succesful self-sufficient, commercially viable artificial, heart was engineered by Century Labatories, part of the biggest technological and medical conglomerate known as The Vega Group. In the year 2056 the first fully digitized brain by the same people. By the year 2100, cyborgs became the majority of the population.

In this future, humans are no longer born due to an accidental biological contanimation that took place decades ago when humans still inhabited earth. The Lazarus incident, or how people call it, Rapture, is an airborn virus, highly congious, engineered to modify every human cell's DNA to prevent telomere degration. However the virus was still in the testing phases. The virus had a major side effect that affected most people. It caused their blood to slowly thicken until reaching cardiac arrest, regardless of any medicine used. This thickening rate takes years to develop.

The virus was poorly contained and escaped from the labotary it was created. Around 6 billion people died prematurely in the span of 15 years. But the worst part is that the people that were not affected by this side effect became infertile, women and men. It took years before scientists caught on to what was happening. Everyone was infected, and there was no vaccine. Everyone's DNA was modified by the virus. Humanity was headed for extinction. It wasn't until The Vega Group, that came up with a device capable of artifically germinating human life in 2068.

The Lazarus Incident took place in the year 2061. As of today, 2115 there are around 21 billion humans spread across the solar system. The virus is still present today, ingrained in everyone's DNA. People susceptible to the blood thickening start showing symptoms in their early tens. When this happens, modern medicine dictates that the treatment is to replace most of the subject's body with prosthetics.

In the year 2091 nuclear war broke out in Earth deeming it uninhabitable. Although it's said some people still live there in bunkers.

The factions that managed to escape the planet before imminent destruction founded their colonies in different parts of the solar system.

The social and political implications of these events radically changed humanity.

### Azula Portable Nuclear Fusion Reactor (AZPNFR) or Azula Reactor or Azula

Azula Portable Nuclear Reactor is a design for a Portable Fusion Reactor proposed by a french scientist known as Piere Halloway in 2062. The original design for this reactor weighted 500 pounds, but there are modern revisions of it weighting less than 100 pounds. The Azula Reactor works similarly to generic Fusion Reactors, but instead of using steam to drive turbines, it uses a very rare type of metal called Azulumiun. Azulumiun when heated produces an electrical discharge 85% proportional in energy to the heat applied. Meaning it has a 85% conversion of thermal energy. This mysterious metal was first found in the core of an asteroid that was theorized to contain large quantities of diamonds. Azulumiun melting point is completely dependant of its ability to discharge. The more heated it gets, the higher the discharge. However, if it were to be isolated, incapable of discharging, it would start losing is structural integratiy. The start melting point of Azulumiun without discharging is 545 C. The material quickly cools off as soon as it's able to discharge.

The French government quickly took over as the first prototype was succesfully tested. The project was never made public up until Alana Industries reported their first successul test of the IVTE. The French government offered their reactor as the potential power source for the IVTE. Alana agreed to work together.

Azulumiun is a very rare metal nowdays, however there's an artificial substitute known as Azulumiun-1010, which is cheaper. Azulumiun-1010 is only 50% as efficient as pure Azulumiun, therefore its energy througput is limited in comparison. Most cheap Azula knockoffs are built using 1010. Low end ships that use 1010 could take around 300% more time to reach top speed.

It's worth mentioning that these reactors are incapable of reaching critical mass without the use of a fissible fuel such as uranium or plutonium.

### IVTE and Instrinsict Fields Manipulation

Interplanetary traveling was made possible by the break of the century: the Interplanetary Vacuumless Thrust Engine (IVTE, or eeft as it's called colloquially). IVTE produces immense accelation capable of reaching 0.99c (99% of the speed of light) in less than one minute. This is however only possible with a Massless Drive (MD). The Massless Drive is capable of physically faking the mass of certain objects connected to the field (including the IVTE), meaning objects within or inside of the husk of the spaceship weight less than a gram but only to the engine as the effect is purely relativistic. One issue of the IVTE is that combining it with the Massless Drive, causes a massive gravitational pull and push around the ship that could potentially cause havok around civialian areas. That's why it's highly illegal engaging full throttle with the IVTE close to a populated areas. There are systems in place to take down any ship that engages full throttle within the bounds of a colony or space station.

The IVTE and Massless Drive were both created by Alana Industries. The MD was the first created, and it was meant to be used for asteroid mining, but never left testing phases. The MD started as a paper on potential applications using Instrinsict Fields Manipulation on the Higgs Boson. IVTE also uses theories proposed by this paper.

The Instrinsict Fields Manipulation (IFM) was a major scientific breakthrough by the end of 2060s. It works through the usage of extremely high energy beams on matter.

The IVTE and MD were very power hungry, and needed a highly specialized setup to run. Alana proposed a concept of a portable nuclear reactor but was soon discarded when the French government reached out to them with the Azula Reactor. After both parties reaching an agreement, the Azula Reactor was selected as the ideal power source for the IVTE/MD combination.

### Theorem Of Jemeran and Zakzzuz in Space Teletarptulation

It's a thesis project by Livio Jemeran y Mellany Zakzzuz that tries to connect two fundamental qualities in the study of Instrinsict Fields that is speculated to allow space bending manipulation. Jemeran and Zakzzuz were born in right before the nuclear war broke out, but their parents manage to get them both on a Ascendance Mission Program designed for people of lower income to move to any of the colonies in the solar system with citizenship and scholarship included. Both were accepted by the UNT where they started their studies in theoretical physics after nailing the exam. They eventually joined the highly prestigious University of Grant Belverede, located in Romdo. Grant Belverede was originally founded by the The Vega Group, but later on the UNT joined the benefectors list. Grant Belverede's specialty is its theorical physics and medicine schools. The majority of the best doctors in the solar system come from GB.

Jemeran and Zakzzuz became the founders of a new field of study derived from the original discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN on earth in the year 2012. This new fields is known as Teletarptulation. In layman terms it's basically the study of space bending and its practical applications. Many scientists regard Teletarptulation as the next major breakthrough in transporation, superseding the IVTE. However many others consider it waste of time and even the seeking of a snake oil. Teletarptulation has presented a lot of problems and barriers. The first one being the amount of energy required to bend space. Every experiment made by both Jemeran and Zakzzuz has cost millions of GEMS to the University.

### Negative-Vacuum Implosive Bomb

With the creation of the IVTE came another revolution in War Weaponary. The NVIB is a planet destroyer bomb. It works the same as the IVTE, but in an inwards manner, utilizing a much bigger version than a standard sized one, and equipped with a several gigatons power source to drive the reaction. This bomb is extremely hard and costly to build. Only one group of people posses this bomb.

### Universal Human Computer Interface 

The UHCI is the chip that allows the brain to control the body of the user. It features a basic wireless (and wired) comunication protocol called Authority Through Extra-Spacial Fidelity (ATESF). This protocol is very susceptible and easy to hack, but is the prime, most basic communication protocol that all cyberbodies must use to interact with external devices. Organizations have built custom software that runs on top of this protocol, called Firewalls, that enhance security. It's recommended that most people turn off this protocol unless they need to use it because most software have vulnerabilities.

### New Internet or Internet

The New Internet uses a lot of the original Internet from Earth. IPv4 and v6 still work. However the vast majority of software and services use IPv9 for packet delivery. The New Internet routers use quantum entanglement for instant delivery of packets. The use of this technology renders issues such as signal reception/strength and latency completely trivial. The brandwidth of this network is theorically unlimited, but of course limited by the capabilities of the routing device. Any Interplanetary router is able of delivering hundreds of thousands of zettabits per second.

Although many personal devices still use electromatic waves, packets would eventually end up on a quantum entaglement capable router for interplanetary communication.

### GEM

The GEM or Gems is the official currency used in this society. It was originally concieved as a decentralized digital currency based on blockchain technology proposed by the currently defunct Alana Industries. Gem works through consensus from nodes in its network. Nodes require a 5th gen Quantum CPU to validate transactions. The fee for transactions heavily depends on the amount of Gems being transfered. Essentially all transactions must include the cost of the fee. One of the main features of GEM is a heavy degree of anominity using the Varsch-Dagguns Algorithm created for Quantum CPUs.

Although Gem is decentralized, and lacks tracking capabilities regarding payments, it's not hard to find the parties involved in a transaction, or the amount of it. But it does require a very capable last gen Quantum CPU. Most businesses use a thirdparty addon software in order to execute official transactions as it's established by the current monetary regulatory entity, called The Galatic Reserve.

Transactions with GEM are instant and reliable. It's also the main currency used by criminals to execute payments.

### Teleperceptive Projections or TPP or Brain Jerk / NeuroProjection

These are a combination of visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, and/or signaled emotions or feelings all packed in single a binary file with the purpose of being played back by a NeuroProjector within a simulation. They're basically movies projected directly to the brain, a like vivid dream, and thus reproducing all the stimuli stored in the file onto the user's psyche. The main difference is that the NeuroProjectors tries to create a simulation utilizing feedback from the brain.

Almost every UHCI chip comes with a NeuroProjector. There also are external NeuroProjectors that are latched around the neck, and a pair of glasses. One disadvantage between the integrated and external NeuroProjector is that the external one isn't capable of reading the user's feedback, and for this reason, the simulation sticks to the perception of the original recorder.

The biggest industry utilizing TPP is the porn industry. But it's also used in Education for training.

### The Genus Race or Ultimate Battle Survival

The Genus Race is a bloodsport hosted by the criminal organization Saborou. It started in the year 2099 when Saborou bought an abandoned Asteroid mining rig off the UNT that was adrift in Venus.

This bloodsport consists of 10 teams of 3 people that fight to death in this mining rig. There is no time limit. A single match usually takes between 3 to 6 hours. It's televised across the solar system by many major streaming networks. The Genus is the brainchild of Jem, who was the original announcer until the third season.

Genus takes place every 6 months, although there has been a few exceptions in which there has been 3 games in a year.

The winning team takes a prize pool of around 100,000 GEMS on average, which is the equivalent of 500 million USD in the year 2023.

Most players of the Genus are some of the most ruthless people in the solar system. The survivors and victors are considered celebrities. The death rate on average of a single match is 80%.

Rules:
- A team may consist of up to 3 players
- Only weapons allowed are gunpowdered guns, electric bows and any type of sharp non-electronic weapon such as swords and knifes. Non-energy grenades are also allowed
- Players drop from the start ship on a position on the rig of their choosing
- Players may only carry up to 50 pounds of stuff at the start of the match
- Players may equip energy chest armor and energy helmet to the match. These discharge with every impact and can be charged in specific charging stations spread across the rig
- Players must equip an Unemotic Control band on their necks. This bad discharges electricity to the nerveous system when players are outside of the zone. Players are completely disallowed to unequip this band. If they do, they're immediatly disquilified and escorted out of the game.
- Friendly fire is allowed
- A player can anytime voluntarily drop out of a match by yelling the keyword at one of the camaras. Although this does not assure that the player's safety
- Cyborg players cannot bring any specialized battle corpus mods.

UNT and Wayland often send their own official teams to these games.

## Officially Recognized Nations/Colonies

### United Nations of Terra (UNT)
UNT was formed by former nations of Earth including: 
- United States Of America
- Mexico
- Canada
- Most South American Countries
- Japan
- South Korea
- United Kingdom
- Australia

UNT began as a massive international governmental project that started just 3 years before the war, in 2088. The USA government originally was part of Alana's project, but ultimately decided to drop out because of lack of control. They decided to buy the IVTE and related technologies from Alana, and start their own project. 

The official languages in the UNT is English, Spanish and Japanese.

### Wayland
Wayland was originally formed by the EU and China, but right before war it was reformed and completely distanced itself from these countries. Similarly to UNT, they also dedicded to buy Alana's technology and do their own thing. Wayland started not more than 2 years after Alana started sending ships to space, in 2087.

The official language in Wayland are English and Chinese.

### VeracrÃºz
VeracrÃºz was an independent group of colonizers before the war, headed by Alana Industries, a company from Earth, the creatorsof the IVTE. The leader of this group was Sir Arthur Velanova, that named the group after his wife, Marta VeracrÃºz Velanova. Russia, India, and France were also major contributors. Alana's project started after one year of the first succesful test of the IVTE in the year 2084.

The official languages in VeracrÃºz are English, Spanish, French.

VeracrÃºz's government structure is actually a hierarchy system tightly correlated to  people's bloodlines. 

Hirarchy: 

AbadiÃº:
    It's the highest recognition. Can only be granted by the Chief Officer Council in charge of Veracruz. In order to part of this county one must be a

Nebado

## Major Factions

### The Federation for The Future Of Humanity or The Federation

It's an interplanetary effort composed by all of the Recognized Nations/Colonies with the sole purpose of uniting humanity's advancement as the best interest for all parties involved.

Ultimately the Federation ends up being an extremely corrupt organization. The federation is regarded to be completely independent in its actions, acting like some sort of Government of the solar system.

It's worth mentioning that the Federation is the only group in the entire solar system that posses the Negative-Vaccuum Implosive bomb. They try to show a humanitarian image to the colonies so they do not threat anyone directly with it, but they do flex about having access to the the bomb through live tests of the device on distant planets to show the its destructive capabilities.

### The Vega Group

The Vega Group is a conglomerate of the most powerful and richest companies in the solar system. They have around thousands of subsidiaries. Their speciality is Military Technology, Medical Technology, and entertainment such as Movies, Shows, Videogames and Teleperceptive Projections.

### Saborou 

It's a massive interplanetary crimical organization headed by Jem. Saborou specializes in human traficking and drugs. But they do, from time to time, jobs for the highest bidder.

Saborou also hosts The Genus Games which is their highest grossing bussiness.

Saborou is actually split in two groups that cohesively act as one. Although Jem is regarded to be the unquestionable boss, the other side of Saborou is actually led by Jem's fiance, Zanzan. 

### Nefastus

It's another interplanetary criminal organization headed by an unknown figure. They're the rivals of Saborou. They also specialize in human trafficking and drugs.

Nefastus send their own official team to the Genus Race. Nefastus holds 40% of the victories of all the matches.

### Nomads

Nomads are settlelers in Europa that refuse to embrace technological advancements. If one their own is incapable of fighting The Lazarus Virus, they allow their death as a necesary step to overcome the evil in the blood casted by the forbidden techonolical advancement. Although, ironically, they use the artificial human germinator created by the Vega group, for new humans.

They do believe technology is evil, a given to humans by the Devil. They're waiting for the first non-infertile human to be born.

Luna is also a potential romantic partner for the Protagonist.

- The Protagonist

The protagonist is a Nomad who was suffering from the Lazarus Virus, however they only started showing symptoms after the age of 18, and the onset was rather abrupt. Afraid of his fellow Nomads catching up to what was happening to them, they decided to leave Europa to seek medical help in Titan. He sneaked out the tribe's compound, and ran away to a near-by military base, and stole one of their ships. But he was very inexperienced in interplanetary traveling. As he was entering Titan, he was shot down by the Protection Squad, as he didn't reduce his speed fast enough when approaching the atmosphere. Trying to survive, he activated the escape pod of the ship, and ended up crashing in the outskirts of DÃ³luz' Dome. A near by citizen spot his escape pod crashing, and went to help. The citizen that helped him was a hacker known Luna Mayer. Luna took The Protagnist to a blackmarket doctor where it was discovered that he was suffering from the side effects of the Lazarus Virus. He was quickly taken to surgery to replace his entire body with prosthetics. It always known to Luna and the doctor that the Protagonist was sort of Nomad because his blood and skin was so clean and he didn't have any implants.

When the Protagonist woke up, he realized he was suffering from major memory loss. But it's unknown if it was due the crash, the rapid advancement of the Lazarus, or the traumatic experience of having one's entire body replaced with prosthetics in a single day which is unsual.

- Mellany Zakzzuz

Mellany is a brilliant theorical physicist and a professor at the University of Grant Belverede

## How it starts

As the Protagnists wakes up, he's informed of the situation. He now owns thousands of Gems in prosthetics to Luna. In order to pay, he's offered a job by her, a cave rescuer. DÃ³luz is an industrial city built near to a system of caves where minerals such as Uranium and Iron in large quantities can be found. However this cave system tends to collapse very often due to the nature of the ground there. The company that owns the cave employs random low-lives for the job of rescuing expensive machinenary, and sometimes, engineer miners that were trapped underground from a collapse. These engineers usually have "Rescue" as part of their contract's benefits.

The protanists is destined to figure out who he is in this world, and either return to the Nomads or stay and live a new life in this city.


## DÃ³luz

DÃ³luz is a city/colony is Titan, one of the moons of Saturn. DÃ³luz was one of the first space colonies, originally founded by Alana Industries. Now part of VeracrÃºz.
There are 50 million people in DÃ³luz. Most of them low-lives. One of the main joints of Century Laboratories is located in DÃ³luz. 
The main transporation is DÃ³luz is the metro as streets are too narrow for for full sized vehicles, and Flying Vehicles are too expensive for the middle class. Most people ride their personal electric vehicles such as bikes and scooters, and then everyone else uses the metro.

DÃ³luz is famous because of its night life. DÃ³luz is one of the few colonies without regulations on sex slaves and age of consent is 15 years old, also most drugs are legal except hard ones.

DÃ³luz law enforcement is called the Protection Squad. Most basic rights of a citizen in DÃ³luz include protection from the Squad, but many of their services are paid such as murder and missing persons investigations.

The city is completely doomed, but the ground under it is actually highly fertile as of now, and inhabited by small purple worms. It's unknown how it happened, but it's said that a secret project carried by an unknown group which consisted in terraforming the floor using a mutated type of worm that survived by eating waste. It seems the city waste management system has been leaking through the base and reaching the worms, keeping them alive.


## Important places

### Nova Horizon [**UNT**]

It's the first and biggest major city/colony in mars part of the UNT. NH was one of the first colonies created from the ground-up for rich people of earth to live in before the war. When earth was destroyed in the war, many people migrated here. There are approximately 80 million people in NH. At least half of the population is middle class.

### Evergrandis [**Wayland**]

It's the second founded and second biggest major city in  mars, part of Wayland. The UNT and Wayland agreed on sharing mars, thus spliting the ownership of the land in half.

Evergrandis is also the second wealthiest colony, after Nova Horizon, in the solar system. Evergrandis is famous because of the high-luxury restaurants and vacation spots. Evergrandis features the biggest artificial ocean in the solar system, very realistically emulating a earth's ocean. 

### Luciras [**UNT**]

### Azuras [**Wayland**]

### Ecarus Nexus [**Wayland**]

### Red Bartalomeo [**VeracrÃºz**]

### Neu Santos [**VeracrÃºz**]

### Yorkers [**UNT**]

### Romdo or The Interplanetary Space Station[**INDEPENDENT**]

It's a luxurious neutral zone Space Station built within 5 years of the destruction of earth with the purpose of hosting the headquaters of The Federation for the Future of Humanity. Although through time it also became a comercial and residential structure. Most of the wealthiests and high society individuals live in Romdo. There are around 150 thousand people living there. It's said it has cost around 3 trillion Gems to build.

The most advanced medical center in the solar system is located in Romdo. They one possess one of the few Psudo-transcriptors in the solar system. A technology capacable of printing entire organs in a mater of hours.

Romdo is orbiting mars on a fixed direction as to be always on top of Nova Horizon.

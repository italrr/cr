## Setting

It's the year 2105. The place is the Dóluz. It's one of the first industrial colonies founded when the space age started 20 years ago, in Titan.

In the year 2033 the first succesful artificial heart was engineered by Century Labatories, part of the biggest technological and medicine conglomerate known as The Vega Group. In the year 2056 the first fully digitilized brain by the same people. By the year 2100, cyborgs became the majority of the population.

In this future, humans are no longer born due to an accidental biological contanimation that took place decades ago when humans still inhabited earth. The Lazarus incident, or how people call it, Rapture, is an airborn virus, highly congious, engineered to modify every human cell's DNA to prevent telomere degration. However the virus was still in the testing phases. The virus had a major side effect that affected most people. It caused their blood to slowly thicken until reaching cardiac arrest, regardless of any medicine used. This thickening rate takes years to develop.

The virus was poorly contained and escaped from the labotary it was created. Around 6 billion people died prematurely in the span of 15 years. But the worst part is that the people that were not affected by this side effect became infertile, women and men. It took years before scientists caught on to what was happening. Everyone was infected, and there was no vaccine. Everyone's DNA was modified by the virus. Humanity was headed for extinction. It wasn't until The Vega Group, that came up with a device capable of artifically germinating human life in 2068.

The Lazarus Incident took place in the year 2061. As of today, 2105 there are around 21 billion humans spread across the solar system. The virus is still present today, ingrained in everyone's DNA. People susceptible to the blood thickening+ start showing symptoms in their early tens. When this happens, modern medicine dictates that the treatment is to replace most of the subject's body with prosthetics, including the brain.

In the year 2091 nuclear war broke out in Earth deeming it uninhabitable. Although it's said some people still live there in bunkers.

The factions that managed to escape the planet before imminent destruction founded their colonies in different parts of the solar system.

The social and political implications of these events radically changed humanity.

The interplanetary travel was made possible by The Interplanetary Vacuumless Thrust Engine (IVTE, or eeft as it's called colloquially). IVTE produces an impressive accelation capable of reaching 0.99c (99% of the speed of light) in less than one minute. This is however only possible with a Massless Drive (MD). The Masless Drive is capable of physically faking the mass of certain objects connected to the field (including the IVTE), meaning objects within or inside of the husk of the spaceship weight less than a gram but only to the engine. One issue of the IVTE is that combining it with the Massless Drive, causes a massive gravitational pull around the ship that could potentially cause havok around infrrascture or civialian areas. That's why it's highly illegal engaging full throttle with the IVTE.

## Officially Recognized Nations

### United Nations of Terra (UNT)
UNT was formed by former nations of Earth including: 
- United States Of America
- South American Countries
- Japan
- South Korea
- United Kingdom

The official languages in the UNT is English, Spanish and Japanese

### Wayland
Wayland was originally formed by China and North Korea, but after the war it was reformed and completely distanced itself from these contries

The official language in Wayland is English 

### Veracrúz
Veracrúz was an independent group of colonizers before the war, headed by Alana Industries, a company from Earth, the first one to invest in the IVTE. The leader of this group was Sir Arthur Velanova, that named the colony after his wife, Marta Veracrúz Velanova. Russia, India, and france were also a major investors in Alana Industries.

The official languages in Veracrúz is English, Spanish, French.

### Factions

### The Federation for The Future Of Humanity
It's an interplanetary effort composed by all of the Recognized Nations with the sole purpose of uniting humanities advancement as the best interest all parties involved.

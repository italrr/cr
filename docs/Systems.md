## Base Stats

Base Stats are defined in the beginning with the character creation. They define the mere essence of the character, its strength and weaknesses. Base Stats **cannot** be changed after character creation, however some equipment or Corpus Mods may be able to increase some of the base stats as long as the user wears them.

Base stats are used to calculate complex stats.

Reading:
- +: Adds
- -: Removes
- ^: Bonus
Each derivative quality is compromised of four(4) 4ths. So, four pluses (++++) means 100%.

However some other base stats can add a bonus of 25% more. Those are marked with ^.
